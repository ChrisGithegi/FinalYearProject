# FinalYearProject
For my Final Year Project: Smart City ANPR Modelling

This project uses anonymised and/or synthesised ANPR data to carry out traffic modelling and mining for smart city management

Taking in Leeds ANPR data, the goal is to organise the data into the most valuable data with no missing fields into rows, Insert the data into knime and have a play with that to get different outputs & from there host that on a webpage
