## FinalYearProject

For my Final Year Project: Smart City ANPR Modelling

This project uses anonymised and/or synthesised ANPR data to carry out traffic modelling and mining for smart city management

Through the input of Leeds ANPR data, the goal is to visualise this information in a format that is presentable to the user allowing the user to retrieve information based on queries made by the user. Simulating Clean Air Zones will allow the user to visualise the amount of revenue that can be created through the input of the previous query, on a daily basis.
